🧠 Depression Detection using Clustering
📌 Overview
This project focuses on using unsupervised machine learning techniques—specifically K-Means Clustering—to identify patterns in survey data that may indicate levels of depression among individuals. Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was also employed to visualize and analyze clusters.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, normalization.

K-Means Clustering: Unsupervised learning to find natural groupings.

PCA: Dimensionality reduction to 2D/3D for visualization.

Cluster Interpretation: Analyzing centroids and average feature values.

🔍 Results
Data points were grouped into clusters representing different mental states.

Cluster centroids were analyzed to understand depression tendencies.

🚀 Getting Started

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Run the notebook DSF_Lab.ipynb in Jupyter or any Python IDE.
